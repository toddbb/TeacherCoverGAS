1) Sheet_Init: currently, maximum of 10 notes; need to find a better way to populate notes;
2) Modal: require user to enter a note before submitting
3) DONE!!!!! email notifications for regisration, unregistration
4) TO DO: CRON -- 
    a) clean up Notes by removing notes related to teachers no longer in the database??? (NO! Should keep record long-term);
    b) end registration past the user-specified end date
    c) auto-email if removed automatically by CRON
5) Check what permissions user needs to grant. For example, "Send email". If so, is there a way around this?
6) 15/12/23 -- client-side script didn't throw error when sending data to server ("deleteUser", but maybe other calls as well)
